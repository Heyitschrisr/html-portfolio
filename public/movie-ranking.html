    This is a sequel to Spiderman from 2002. This movie holds a speical place<br/>
    in my heart. I have always been a spiderman fan and to me this is the perfect<br/>
    spiderman movie. This movie makes me feel like anything is posssible and<br/>
    that we all have a hero inside of us.

<p>
    This is a movie about Mark Zuckerburg the creator of Facebook. It is a dramatization<br/>
    of how Facebook was made but, my take away from this movie is how someone<br/> can 
    create something so big and mainstream with an idea and his skills on a computer.
